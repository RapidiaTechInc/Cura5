[5.1.1]
* New features:
- Added support for the Ultimaker S3 and Ultimaker S5 updated mainbord


<i>MacOS 10.15 is no longer supported. Technically this means Ultimaker will stop testing and developing for such operating systems. However, even though it is no longer supported, there is still a high likelihood the application keeps functioning.</i>

[5.1]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 5.1, please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/7jetjsHLIvk">our video</a>.</i>

* Improved toolpath simplification algorithm
The algorithm that reduces the resolution of the print has been rewritten, providing a more constant resolution to allow for greater precision without causing buffer underruns.

* Added option to alternate wall direction
A new setting causes the direction of printing walls to alternate between layers and adjacent walls, which reduces warping in the print.

* Adjusted combing boundaries to reduce scarring
Travel moves through the inside of the models are adjusted so that they should keep more distance from the model where possible, yet allowing travels through narrow parts without retractions.

* Reduced acceleration and jerk commands for travel moves
We added the option to disable acceleration and jerk commands for travel moves. If disabled, they will take on the acceleration of the printed part of its destination. This greatly reduces file size and buffer underruns.

* Project files know which packages they require
Newly created project files will now store which packages they require from the Ultimaker Marketplace. If a project needs a material from there, the user will be prompted to download it.

* Other new features and improvements:
- The interface to select the printing profile in Recommended Mode has been redesigned.
- Implemented multi-threaded slicing for MacOS, to bring it in line with other operating systems, contributed by Piezoid.
- Cura now links toolpaths to project files in the Digital Factory.
- Improved performance of loading STL files on Linux.
- Packages from the Marketplace can now contain intent profiles.
- The application now makes heavy use of Conan to make it easier and faster to build releases of Cura.
- Start and end g-code can now refer to the currently active profile with replacement keys.

- Fix a bug where Remove Raft Inside Corners didn't always remove all corners.
- Fix the position of the toolbar if the toolbar is too tall to fit.
- Intents in the Recommended Mode now show a description again.

- Fix an error sometimes occurring when uninstalling plug-ins.
- Fix a rendering issue with pop-up dialogues on MacOS.
- Fix Discard or Keep Changes dialog showing an outdated setting value.

- Fix opening STL files with special characters in their file header.
- Fix slicing failure when using Randomize Infill Start in some cases.

We’ve tweaked the Monotonic setting and made adjustments throughout Ultimaker print profiles. This removes occasional scarring on models and improves top surface quality by default. 

* Improved horizontal print quality
Resulting in reduction of ringing, improving resolution and overall print quality.  

* App switcher
The new switcher provides a simpler way to navigate and use other Ultimaker applications, including Ultimaker Digital Factory, Ultimaker Marketplace, and Ultimaker 3D Printing Academy. Reporting bugs to Github is now just one click away, and it’s easier to find the application you need.

* Faster start-up
We've shaved 10 seconds from Ultimaker Cura's start-up time by optimizing profile data caching.

* Other new features:
- Moved the skip button to the left bottom on the sign in onboarding page and replaced with the sign in button and Create new account
- Add {material_type} and {material_name} as replacement patterns, contributed by fieldOfView

[4.11.0]
<i>For an overview of the new features in Cura 4.11, please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/OcFkcDyO5DU">our video</a>.</i>

* Monotonic ordering
The new Monotonic top/bottom order setting enables users to print parts with smoother top surfaces. This is especially useful for parts that need good aesthetics, such as visual prototypes. Or for parts that benefit from smooth surfaces, such as those that contact-sensitive components. 

* Complete UI refresh
Look around and you will notice that we have refreshed over 100 icons throughout Ultimaker Cura. The new icons are designed for clarity – resulting in a simpler and more informative slicing experience. Also, when scaling the Ultimaker Cura window, the UI will adapt, resulting in less visual clutter.

* Improved digital library integration
Collaborative workflows using the Digital Library are now simpler. Every user with a cloud-connected Ultimaker 3D printer can access stored projects. And we have added a “Search” function to make finding files easier.

* Save materials profiles to USB
Users can now save all third-party material profiles to USB. <i>This feature is for Ultimaker S-line printers only and is especially useful for cloud-connected (or offline) printers.</i>

* Notifications for beta and plugin releases
Users can now set notification preferences to alert them to new Ultimaker Cura beta and plug-in releases.

* Improve logging of errors in OAuth flow
When helping a user with log-in problems it is easier to see where the OAuth flow goes wrong.

* Search in the description in the settings visibility menu
When searching in the settings visibility menu you will also search in the description of the settings.

* Bug fixes:
- Fixed the setting visibility button to make it easier to click
- Inform the user that their webcam does not work because they are cloud connected
- Inform the user that their webcam does not work if the firewall is enabled
- Fixed a crash when pressing the slice button while context menu is opened 
- Support non-ASCII character in the Digital Library project name
- Fixed integer underflow if print is less than half the initial layer height
- Fixed a bug where infill mesh sometimes default to having walls or skin
- Fix builds with Python 3.8, contributed by StefanBruens

*<i>From version 4.11 onwards - Ultimaker Cura is only supported on operating systems actively maintained by their software manufacturer or community. This means Windows 7 and MacOS 10.13 will no longer be supported. Technically this means Ultimaker will stop testing and developing for such operating systems. However, even though it is no longer supported, there is still a high likelihood the application keeps functioning.</i>
